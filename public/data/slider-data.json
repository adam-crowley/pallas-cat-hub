    "title": "1. The Pallas' cat also goes by the name manul",
    "text": "German naturalist Peter Pallas originally classified the cat as Felis manul in 1776. The word 'manul' has its roots in the Mongolian language. Its current scientific name, Otocolobus, comes from the Greek language and can be translated to 'ugly-eared.' When Pallas first described the cat, he erroneously suggested it was the ancestor of the domestic Persian breed because of its long fur, stout build, and flattened face."

    "text": "Pallas' cats appear to be bigger and heavier than they actually are due to their stocky builds and long, dense coats. In reality, they're about the size of domestic cats: they measure up to 26 inches in body length (with an 8-12 inch tail) and weigh only around 10 pounds."
