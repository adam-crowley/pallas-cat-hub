    "text": "German naturalist Peter Pallas originally classified the cat as Felis manul in 1776. The word 'manul' has its roots in the Mongolian language. Its current scientific name, Otocolobus, comes from the Greek language and can be translated to 'ugly-eared.'"

    "title": "2. All that fluff creates the illusion of size",
    "text": "Pallas' cats appear to be bigger and heavier than they actually are due to their stocky builds and long, dense coats. In reality, they're about the size of domestic cats: they measure up to 26 inches in body length (with an 8-12 inch tail) and weigh only around 10 pounds."

    "title": "5. Pallas' cats have the longest and densest fur of any cat",
    "text": "Their fur is nearly twice as long on their belly and tail as on their top and sides. Presumably, this helps keep the cats warm as they hunt on snow or frozen ground. The length and density of their fur also changes seasonally, growing longer and heavier in the winter."

    "title": "6. Pallas' cats are loners",
