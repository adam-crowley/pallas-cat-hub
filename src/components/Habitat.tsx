              The Pallas's cat's range extends from the Caucasus eastward to
              Central Asia, Mongolia and adjacent parts of Dzungaria and the
              Tibetan Plateau. It inhabits montane shrublands and grasslands,
              rocky outcrops, scree slopes and ravines in areas, where the
              continuous snow cover is below 15–20 cm (6–8 in). In the
              southwestern part of its range, the habitat of the Pallas's cat is
              affected by cold and dry winters, and moderate to low rainfall in
              warm summers.
